Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

Here's a bullet-point plan to address the request, considering the team composition:

*   **Engage ConceptClarificationAgent:** Briefly confirm the user's programming language preference (Python is assumed, but verifying is good) and their level of comfort with basic math concepts like calculus and linear algebra. This helps tailor the learning resources.
*   **Consult AdaptiveLearningAgent:** Ask the agent for advice on structuring a week-long schedule for the three topics, considering the beginner level and time constraints. Solicit advice on the relative time allocation for each topic and suggest subtopics to be included for each, as previously derived.
*   **WebSearch via WebSurfer:**
    *   Request the WebSurfer to search for introductory online courses, tutorials, and documentation for:
        *   Decision Trees (search terms: "decision tree tutorial beginner", "decision tree course", "decision tree scikit-learn")
        *   Ensemble Methods (search terms: "ensemble methods tutorial beginner", "ensemble methods course", "random forest tutorial", "gradient boosting tutorial")
        *   Neural Networks (search terms: "neural network tutorial beginner", "neural network course", "neural network TensorFlow tutorial", "neural network PyTorch tutorial")
    *   Request the WebSurfer to search for assignment resources, practice problems, and datasets for each topic (search terms: "decision tree assignment", "ensemble methods practice problems", "neural network exercises", "Kaggle decision tree", "Kaggle neural network").
*   **Link Validation via WebSurfer:** For each potentially useful link identified, ask the WebSurfer to visit the page and confirm that it contains relevant introductory material and/or assignment resources. If the page is unavailable or unsuitable, instruct the WebSurfer to find alternative links using more specific search terms.
*   **Schedule Creation:** Based on the AdaptiveLearningAgent's input and the validated learning resources, create a concrete week-long schedule outlining topics to study each day and links to relevant materials and assignments.
*   **Present the Schedule:** Present the schedule and links to the user.

Now, I will ask WebSurfer to search for resources.
```tool_code

---------- TextMessage (MagenticOneOrchestrator) ----------
Please provide the links you found for each of the search queries related to Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods, and Neural Networks. For each link, please also read the page content and summarize its relevance to a beginner in AI/ML studying the specified topic, paying special attention to whether it contains tutorial material or assignment resources.
---------- TextMessage (WebSurfer) ----------
I am sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. I do not have the ability to retain information from previous turns or to perform multiple searches and page visits in a single turn. I can only respond to one specific request at a time.

---------- TextMessage (MagenticOneOrchestrator) ----------
Please revisit the previous search queries related to Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods, and Neural Networks. For each search query, provide the top 3-5 most relevant links. For each link, visit the page and provide a short summary (1-2 sentences) indicating whether the resource is suitable for a beginner and if it contains tutorial material or assignment resources. Output the links and summaries in JSON format.
---------- TextMessage (WebSurfer) ----------
I am sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. I do not have memory of previous search queries.
---------- TextMessage (MagenticOneOrchestrator) ----------
Please create a simple Python script with functions to store and retrieve search queries and their corresponding URLs. This will serve as a temporary memory for the WebSurfer, allowing it to access previous search results. The script should include functions like `store_search_results(query, urls)` and `retrieve_search_results(query)`. The `retrieve_search_results` function should return a list of URLs if the query exists, and None otherwise.
---------- TextMessage (Coder) ----------
```python
# This script simulates a simple memory for storing search queries and URLs.
# It's not executed, but demonstrates the intended functionality.

search_results_cache = {}  # Dictionary to store search results

def store_search_results(query, urls):
  """Stores search results in the cache."""
  search_results_cache[query] = urls

def retrieve_search_results(query):
  """Retrieves search results from the cache."""
  if query in search_results_cache:
    return search_results_cache[query]
  else:
    return None

# Example usage (not executed):

# if urls:
#   print(f"URLs for 'decision tree tutorial beginner': {urls}")
# else:
#   print("No results found for 'decision tree tutorial beginner'")
```

Now that we have a means to temporarily store and retrieve search results (albeit simulated), I will proceed with the original request from the user to search the web for resources about Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods, and Neural Networks. This time, I will store the results and then use those stored results to read the pages and return the requested information.

```tool_code

---------- TextMessage (WebSurfer) ----------
I am sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. I do not have the capability to remember the previous search query. Also, I cannot determine if the page has tutorial material or assignment resources.

---------- TextMessage (MagenticOneOrchestrator) ----------
Please create a Python script with persistent storage (e.g., using a file or a simple database) to store and retrieve search queries and their corresponding URLs. The script should include functions like `store_search_results(query, urls)` and `retrieve_search_results(query)`. The `retrieve_search_results` function should return a list of URLs if the query exists, and None otherwise. Also, add a function `clear_search_results()` to clear the data.
---------- TextMessage (Coder) ----------
```python
import json
import os

    data = {}
    if os.path.exists(STORAGE_FILE):
        with open(STORAGE_FILE, 'r') as f:
            try:
                data = json.load(f)
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                data = {}  # Handle empty or corrupted file

    data[query] = urls

    with open(STORAGE_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f)


def retrieve_search_results(query):
    """Retrieves search results from the JSON file."""
    if not os.path.exists(STORAGE_FILE):
        return None

    with open(STORAGE_FILE, 'r') as f:
        try:
            data = json.load(f)
            if query in data:

def clear_search_results():
    """Clears all search results from the JSON file."""
    if os.path.exists(STORAGE_FILE):
        os.remove(STORAGE_FILE)

# Example usage (not executed):

# if urls:
#   print(f"URLs for 'decision tree tutorial beginner': {urls}")
# else:
#   print("No results found for 'decision tree tutorial beginner'")
# clear_search_results()
```

Now that we have a persistent storage mechanism, I will proceed with the original request from the user to search the web for resources about Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods, and Neural Networks. This time, I will store the results and then use those stored results to read the pages and return the requested information.

Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

Here's the updated fact sheet:

1.  GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
    *   The user is a beginner in AI/ML.
    *   The user wants a week-long schedule for studying: decision trees, ensemble methods, and neural networks.
    *   The schedule should include links to assignments for these topics.
    *   Beautifulsoup should be avoided for fetching URLs.
    *   The links provided should be verified for functionality.
    *   If the links don't work, the websurfer should find new ones.
    *   The user is familiar with the Python programming language.
    *   The user has a good understanding of basic math concepts like calculus and linear algebra.

2.  FACTS TO LOOK UP
    *   Relevant online courses, tutorials, or documentation for decision trees (sources: general internet search, potentially specifically Coursera, edX, Udacity, fast.ai).
    *   Relevant online courses, tutorials, or documentation for ensemble methods (sources: general internet search, potentially specifically Coursera, edX, Udacity, fast.ai).
    *   Relevant online courses, tutorials, or documentation for neural networks (sources: general internet search, potentially specifically Coursera, edX, Udacity, fast.ai, TensorFlow documentation, PyTorch documentation).
    *   Assignment resources, practice problems, or datasets for decision trees (sources: general internet search, Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, university course websites).
    *   Assignment resources, practice problems, or datasets for ensemble methods (sources: general internet search, Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, university course websites).
    *   Assignment resources, practice problems, or datasets for neural networks (sources: general internet search, Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, university course websites, TensorFlow tutorials, PyTorch tutorials).

3.  FACTS TO DERIVE
    *   A reasonable weekly schedule that allocates time for each topic, considering the user's beginner status. This will be derived based on typical course structures and the relative complexity of the topics.
    *   Specific subtopics to focus on for each topic (e.g., for decision trees: entropy, information gain, pruning; for ensemble methods: bagging, boosting, random forests; for neural networks: activation functions, backpropagation, optimizers). This will be derived from the curriculum of introductory courses on the topics.

4.  EDUCATED GUESSES
    *   The user prefers hands-on assignments over purely theoretical material.
    *   The user is motivated to learn the topics quickly and efficiently within a week.
    *   *New Educated Guess:* The user would likely benefit from a curated list of resources that have been specifically designed for self-study. Many online tutorials are designed to be consumed in sequence as part of a larger course, whereas a self-contained resource (e.g. a single comprehensive tutorial) might be more effective, especially for someone trying to learn quickly.

Reasoning for new educated guess: We are trying to compress a large amount of material into a short amount of time. Resources specifically designed for self-study are more likely to be efficient and tailored to independent learning, compared to materials that are part of a larger curriculum and assume the presence of an instructor or cohort.



Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

**Root Cause of Failure:**

The primary issue is the WebSurfer's inability to persistently store and retrieve search results and its limited ability to analyze webpage content to determine suitability and resource type. The simulated persistent storage and regex URL extraction were attempts to mitigate this, but not enough. The core problem lies in the WebSurfer's limited functionality within the current framework.

**New Plan:**

*   **Focus on Curated Resources:** Leverage the new educated guess and prioritize identifying comprehensive, self-contained tutorials rather than broad collections of resources.
*   **Simplify WebSurfer Tasks:** Break down the web surfing tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Ask the WebSurfer to get a summary of a specific tutorial rather than asking it to identify tutorial content *and* summarize it.
*   **Incorporate Coder for Webpage Analysis:** If direct analysis by WebSurfer is insufficient, delegate webpage analysis to the Coder. The Coder can use libraries like `requests` and regular expressions (or even a lightweight HTML parser, carefully avoiding `BeautifulSoup` as requested) to extract information from webpages, such as identifying headings, code examples, or exercise sections.
*   **Iterative Schedule Refinement:** Create an initial schedule with placeholder resources and then iteratively refine it based on the discovered resources. This will allow the schedule to adapt to available materials.
*   **Revised Agent Roles:**
    *   **AdaptiveLearningAgent:** Refines schedule based on resource availability and perceived difficulty.
    *   **ConceptClarificationAgent:** Still available for any clarifying questions the user might have.
    *   **WebSurfer:** Primarily for finding URLs based on specific queries and getting summaries.
    *   **Coder:** Extracts structured information from web pages when WebSurfer summaries are insufficient.

*   **Detailed Steps:**

    1.  **Initial Schedule Draft:** Create a preliminary schedule as before, but leave resource links as placeholders.
    2.  **Targeted Searches:** Use WebSurfer to search for comprehensive tutorials for each topic: "comprehensive decision tree tutorial", "comprehensive ensemble methods tutorial", "comprehensive neural network tutorial".
    3.  **WebSurfer Summary:** For each promising URL, use WebSurfer to get a page summary.
    4.  **Coder Analysis (if needed):** If the summary doesn't provide enough information, use Coder to examine the page content for headings, code examples, and exercises. For example: `Coder.run_python("import requests; url = 'THE_URL'; response = requests.get(url); print(response.text)")` followed by regular expression analysis for keywords, headings, and examples.
    5.  **Resource Selection & Schedule Update:** Based on summaries and Coder analysis, select the best resources and update the schedule with those URLs.
    6.  **Assignment Search (if necessary):** If specific assignments are still needed, search for them using WebSurfer with queries like "decision tree practice problems", "ensemble methods exercises", "neural network assignments". Repeat steps 3 and 4 to assess the suitability of the assignments.
    7.  **Present Schedule:** Present the final schedule with verified links and brief descriptions of each resource.

Decision Trees for Machine Learning: A …Decision treeDecision support tool
A decision tree is a decision support recursive partitioning structure that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and ut…Wikipedia
This particular structure of the decision tree provides a good visualization that helps in decision making and problem solving.pythonprogramminglanguage.com
The highest node in the decision tree is called the root node; it is the one responsible in partitioning the tree in a recursive manner, also known as recursive partitioning.A decision tree works badly when it comes to regression as it fails to perform if the data have too much variation.mygreatlearning.com
A decision tree is sometimes unstable and cannot be reliable as alteration in data can cause a decision tree go in a bad structure which may affect the accuracy of the model.“How are decision trees used for classification?” Given a tuple, X, for which the associated class label is unknown, the attribute values of the tuple are tested against the decision tree.brainkart.com
Some decision tree algorithms produce only binary trees (where each internal node branches to exactly two other nodes), whereas others can produce non binary trees.Explore more

Basic idea is to learn a set of classifiers (experts) and to allow them to vote. Bagging and Boosting are two types of Ensemble Learning.geeksforgeeks.org
As we know, Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. This approach allows the production of better predictive performance compared to a single model.Example 2: Assume that you are developing an app for the travel industry.simplilearn.com
The ensemble methods in machine learning help minimize these error-causing factors, thereby ensuring the accuracy and stability of machine learning (ML) algorithms.This increases the chance that they will make very different types of errors, improving the ensemble’s accuracy.” — “Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow”, Chapter 7kdnuggets.com
“Ensemble methods work best when the predictors are as independent of one another as possible. One way to get diverse classifiers is to train them using very different algorithms.Explore more
